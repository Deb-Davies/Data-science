# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio — a collection of exploratory projects, applied research, and workflow prototypes that showcase my approach to solving complex problems using structured analytics and modern tools.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a mathematician and national security intelligence officer turned data scientist, with 16+ years of experience navigating ambiguity, extracting signal from noise, and transforming mission-critical information into operational insight. I specialize in:

- Structured data modeling and visualization  
- Applied statistics, machine learning, and feature engineering  
- Secure, regulated, and real-world decision environments  

Currently an all-but-dissertation PhD candidate, my research focuses on modeling blind spots in justice system and human trafficking data.

## 🔬 Featured Projects

### 📊 Structured Analytics Pipeline (iHRM Dataset)
- SQL + Python workflow to model structured human systems data  
- Schema design, JOIN logic, exploratory visualizations  
- Focus on surfacing relational patterns across demographic and performance variables  

### 🧠 AI-Augmented Risk Detection
- Applied to human trafficking and law enforcement data  
- Hybrid methods integrating statistical models and qualitative risk indicators  
- Future plans for NLP integration  

## 🧰 Tools & Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Environments**: Jupyter, Git, GitHub  
- **Other**: SPSS, Tableau, i2 Analyst’s Notebook, OSINT tools
