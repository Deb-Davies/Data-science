# iHRM Data Analysis – Structured Analytics in Jupyter

This project analyzes international HRM survey data using structured analytic techniques, Python workflows, and statistical modeling. Built in a Jupyter Notebook, the workflow includes preprocessing, factor analysis, t-tests, and visualizations to support evidence-based insight generation.

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Explore patterns in HRM survey data across countries and demographics
- Identify latent constructs via factor analysis
- Evaluate differences using statistical testing
- Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SPSS (initial exploratory work)
- Markdown + visuals for documentation

## 🧠 Key Techniques

- Factor Analysis (PCA)
- Likert Scale Transformation & Cleaning
- t-Tests, ANOVA, Chi-squared tests
- Scree plot generation, KPI table summaries
- Structured analysis aligned with decision-maker needs

## 📝 Output Highlights

- Latent constructs tied to employee thriving and satisfaction
- Visualization of item loadings and factor clusters
- Summary dashboards highlighting group differences
- Recommendations for further survey refinement
